    Weighting four round and 500m swimming (50m legs, 50m each side hand, 400m free style) <br>
    Coming up with the idea of catching water. <br><br>
    I have learned three ways of catching water : <br>
    1. Huang Her (Yilan butterflt style champion, my friend) : <br> 
    Let your arm be parallel to your body, then drawing a "P" by your hand. <br>
    2. Some coach in the Luodong swimming pool for the safety guard training : <br>
    Drawing a "S" by your hand. <br>
    3. NTU swimming teacher : <br>
    Let your arm be 7 degree with your trunk, then moving your hand right until it becomes <br>
    parallel to your trunk, then moving backward. <br>
