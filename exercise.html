    0:3 a young, skillful guy Dai <br>
    Problem : Receiving his serve poor, my movement is too large and is not efficient, not so patient <br>
    to deal with some ball i know the better way to deal with. <br><br>
    2:3 left hand Cheng wei how <br>
    Problem : The footwork to the right side to pull up the short ball is intuitive and may be not efficient, <br>
    arm waving is too large as a result i can not deal with the later ball well even i know how to do, <br>
    receiving is another big problem, especially for the down spin fast ball, just pull it up and wait for the <br>
    next. <br><br>

    Weighting four round and 500m swimming (50m legs, 50m each side hand, 400m free style) <br>
    Coming up with the idea of catching water. <br><br>
    I have learned three ways of catching water : <br>
    1. Huang Her (Yilan butterfly style champion, my friend) : <br> 
    Let your arm be parallel to your body, then drawing a "P" by your hand. <br>
    2. Some coach in the Luodong swimming pool for the safety guard training : <br>
    Drawing a "S" by your hand. <br>
    3. NTU swimming teacher : <br>
    Let your arm be 7 degree with your trunk, then moving your hand right until it becomes <br>
    parallel to your trunk, then moving backward. <br>
