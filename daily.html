    <h1>2020/11/05 THU</h1>
    Sellers of blue tooth earphone should contact all the suck class in NTU. They can make money by each other. <br>
    Having a strong feeling about table tennis at about 19, asked two people to play but they are busy. <br>
    Went to the basement of man first dormitory to practice serving. A junior student found that I beated him <br>
    in NTU cup, he asked me to play with him. It feels like I have some fans.

    <!--Woke up early, went to shueyuan market to buy the pig eyes for experiment for the senior student who <br>
    takes project class of my professor. I was late because i went to fight some legendary pokemon, i am sorry. <br>
    I asked F for lunch in taipower building station at 12, But in the morning my profesor said that today is the <br>
    birthday of the post-doctor in our lab, we had to sing a song for her and eat cake together. Professor <br>
    said it may be 11:40. It is weird that two times in four i asked F out for meal just meets the birthday <br> 
    of somebody in the lab. I left at 11:40, I got there 12:05. The restaurant was so great, 150 dollars for <br>
    layer spaghetti and soup and baked putting. We had a great talk, i know her more. Having intermediate dynamic in the afernoon. <br>
    At night went to guting to play tabletennis, felt great, though i still have a lot to learn. -->

    of my professor, but his attitude was bad. Having lunch in a great restaurant, 150 dollars for spaghetti, soup <br> 
    and baked putting. In the night, as usual, I went to play tabletennis in guting, which I felt good. 
    <h1>2020/11/02 MON</h1>
    Feeling bad when i tried to buck up for the girl that i am chasing, it feel like  i can't not work hard for myself. <br>
    But the girl is so cute, so, you know. <br>
    Now we have the problem : what is a relationship with girls? <br>
    I have no idea.
