    <h1>2020/11/17 TUE</h1>
    Tried to be the santa in the activity of NTU library. The activity is that you pick a book, and give some <br>
    hints for this book, library will pocket that book and write the hints you have written on the pocket. Someone <br>
    finds that the hints is interesting can borrow the book, then finds out what the book it is. I choose <br>
    'point graph and group', the hints were : "Just likes every movie ends with the concept love, it is a universal <br>
    language of this world." and "no one is an island, you can definitely find someone special to you in a group." <br>
    I can explain the hints, first, math is an universal language of this world, and in a group, every element can find <br>
    its inverse, which is special to the element. I was such a genius, but i was scared to gave my apply to the staffs <br>
    of the library. Yeah, I fleed. 
    <h1>2020/11/16 MON</h1>
    The employee of the Biomechanic department came to lab to tell me that I have to finish my job of the <br>
    environmental security. I had to let all the members in the lab to memorize the emergency phone number of NTU <br>
    campus, 3366-9110. In addition, I had to find the verification data of the drill machine in room 530. <br> 
    But everyone knows that every lab has some unverified tools or machine or worsen, animal tissue, and so on. <br>
    Why this woman pretended that everyone follow the rules? And she was even reluctant to help me, which made me <br>
    so dissapointed about her. Po-Jeng asked my what happen, I told him, he laughed. He said he used to do same thing <br>
    when he served in the military. So he just laughed. <br>
     Meeting in the afternoon. Po-Jeng was a little bit affectionate, he told lots of stories about his life.  
    <h1>2020/11/15 SUN</h1>
    Woke up at 730, went to library. taught tabletennis to the physic bro at 1200. Struggling for the title of my <br>

    <h1>2020/11/06 FRI</h1>
    Finishing the simulation of cytokinesis in the afternoon, though it was just a little and initial part of <br>
    the thesis, I felt happy and would like to talk to somebody that i did it, but, there was no one there, or <br>
    she was not there. I went to sugar man cafe, but the music was annoyed and loud, so i left in one hour. <br>  
    At the night, i brought my guitar to the back grass of the old gym in NTU. There were some couple there. <br>
    
    <!--woke up late, go to lab, doing nothing in morning. in the afternoon i finish the simulation of cytokinesis
    in matlab, i felt fulfill. read some PCO paper. would like to talk to fenwen, but it seems like i failed. 
    doing the experiment because i did not know what can i do when i went back to dorm, so i stayed in the lab. But
    yashing coming, he would like to ask me to play tabletennis with him, which i don't like. as a result, i fleed. 
    in the dorm, i was wondering what i can do in this night. it seemed like i failed in fenwen, adn everything
    is meaningless, so depress. in that instance, the cafe that Grace went to came up to my mind, so i went to
    118 to have dinner. there were lots of couple hugging on the street, but me, lonely. eating I'm pasta. then
    went to the cafe Grace recommend, but it seemed to be annoyed and dark. so i came up with the cafe which fenwen
    recommend, but i was reluctant, but i would like to see, but, lots of but. life is so hard, we chase, we fail
    , we depressed and cry, all for the love. everyone is reasonable, but there must be someone hurt. it feel like
    we can abondont the desire to find someone we loved to avoid this problem, but is that good? is that an escape?
    i do not know, how should i do? can i make a come back? all i know is nothing but the mixed feeling. i said this
    to Winnie, she said something to me, but i still felt sad and depressed. i went to sugar man cafe, the cafe which
    fenwen recommend me. i had a seat in the desk in front of the cofe machine and clerk. i ordered a cup of milk and
    milk-wine (barys milk-wine). so sad, and the music in the cafe is annoyed. i fleed, like what i always do.  -->
    <h1>2020/11/05 THU</h1>
    Sellers of blue tooth earphone should contact all the suck class in NTU. They can make money by each other. <br>
    Having a strong feeling about table tennis at about 19, asked two people to play but they are busy. <br>
    Went to the basement of man first dormitory to practice serving. A junior student found that I beated him <br>
    in NTU cup, he asked me to play with him. It feels like I have some fans.  
    <h1>2020/11/04 WED</h1>
    <!--Woke up early, went to shueyuan market to buy the pig eyes for experiment for the senior student who <br>

    I asked F for lunch in taipower building station at 12, But in the morning my profesor said that today is the <br>
    birthday of the post-doctor in our lab, we had to sing a song for her and eat cake together. Professor <br>
    said it may be 11:40. It is weird that two times in four i asked F out for meal just meets the birthday <br> 
    of somebody in the lab. I left at 11:40, I got there 12:05. The restaurant was so great, 150 dollars for <br>
    layer spaghetti and soup and baked putting. We had a great talk, i know her more. Having intermediate dynamic in the afernoon. <br>
