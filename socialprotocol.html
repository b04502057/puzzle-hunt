<body>
    here i would list some social protocol that i learned by myself. <br><br>
    1. get familiar with the tamper of the most influential relative in your family, rebeling this people will make you 
    have a hard time in traditional festivals. <br><br>
    2. you can not post any information about girls of your bro, keep it secret. <br>
    remark:i do not think so. when there are girls, there is no bro? check out the second line 
    of <a href="./broscode.html">bro's code</a>. <br>
    3. when there are somebody visit your company and you are going to have pizza together, you can not eat too much, 
    but they will not eat too much either, so at the end you can eat many pizza, but you just have to wait<br>
    4. sending your friend meaningless email may be annoyed. <br>
    5. you will never know what are the purposes of girls in friend-making software. <br>
    6. couple conquering road by holding hands or hugging is not cool. <br>
    7. a single(in romance) person wearing fancy does not mean he or she is going to date with somebody, guessing 
    it and say it to them or others is rude. <br>
    8. couple can show how sweety they are on the internet without informing anybody. <br>
    9. people who like to use cool as their primary adjective is pretty cool, and hilarious. <br>
    10. if you have some conflicts about music with an unfamiliar friend, discussing another song immediately. <br>
    11. Someone does not want to chat with you if he or she does not reply your message for two days. <br>
