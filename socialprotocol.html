<body>
    here i would list some social protocol that i learned by myself. <br><br>
    1. get familiar with the tamper of the most influential relative in your family, rebeling this people will make you 
    have a hard time in traditional festivals. <br><br>
    2. you can not post any information about girls of your bro, keep it secret. <br>
    remark:i do not think so. when there are girls, there is no bro? check out the second line 
    of <a href="./broscode.html">bro's code</a>. <br>
