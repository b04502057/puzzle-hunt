<body>
    here i would list some social protocol that i learned by myself. <br><br>
    1. get familiar with the tamper of the most influential relative in your family, rebeling this people will make you 
    have a hard time in traditional festivals. <br><br>
    2. you can not post any information about girls of your bro, keep it secret. <br>
    remark:i do not think so. when there are girls, there is no bro? check out the second line 
    of <a href="./broscode.html">bro's code</a>. <br>
    3. when there are somebody visit your company and you are going to have pizza together, you can not eat too much, 
    but they will not eat too much either, so at the end you can eat many pizza, but you just have to wait<br>
    4.
