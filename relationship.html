    girls think they are fat, but you can only deny or say you're ok with that <br>
    you can say that chubby girl is good for hug (but notice sexsual harrasment) <br>
    if girls are angry, they would type哈哈是喔 <br>

    1. use the other information to correct the feeling and both of the disadvantage <br>
    for example : <br>
    "I think your idea last time you said is brilliant" <br>
    "b.t.w, what your favorite song?" <br> <br>
    in this case we can see that both the messeage can lead to dead end. 

    <h2>paper research - Hormonal changes when falling in love</h2>
    To fall in love is the first step in pair formation in humans and is a complex process which only recently has become the object of neuroscientific investigation. The little information available in this field prompted us to measure the levels of some pituitary, adrenal and gonadal hormones in a group of 24 subjects of both sexes who had recently fallen in love, and to compare them with those of 24 subjects who were single or were part of a long-lasting relationship. The following hormones were evaluated by means of standard techniques : FSH, LH, estradiol, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate(DHEAS), cortisol, testosterone and androstenedione. 
The results showed that estradiol, progesterone, DHEAS and androstenedione levels did not differ between the groups and were within the normal ranges. Cortisol levels were significantly higher amongst those subjects who had recently fallen in love, as compared with those who had not. FSH and testosterone levels were lower in men in love, while women of the same group presented higher testosterone levels. All hormonal differences were eliminated when the subjects were re-tested from 12 to 24 month later. The increased cortisol and low FSH levels are suggestive of the “stressful” and arousing conditions associated with the initiation of a social contact. The changes of testosterone concentrations, which varied in opposite directions in the two sexes, may reflect changes in behavioural and/or temperamental traits which have yet to be clarified. In conclusion, the findings of the present study would indicate that to fall in love provokes transient hormonal changes some of which seem to be specific to each sex.
